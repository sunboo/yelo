Idea 
====

An idea on its own is just that - an idea. 
I believe that the idea acts as a multiplier of sorts and the better the execution the more awesome the value which is created.

**Idea as Multiplier**

Awful = -1,
Weak = 1,
So-so = 5,
Good = 10,
Great = 15,
Brilliant = 20,

**Execution as Value Creation**

No = $0,
Weak = $1k,
So-so = $10k,
Good = $100k,
Great = $1M,
Brilliant = $10M

Horizontal vs. Vertical
=======================


In five years that you’re going to have an app for house cleaners, an app for electricians, an app for tutors, and on and on. 

No. You’re going to have one app to stay in touch with the professionals that you know and love.
