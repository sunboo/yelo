============

what is yelo? yelo is Delhi's hustle and Bangalore's focus. 

yelo (https://www.facebook.com/yelo.red) is a mobile only, android first peer-to-peer marketplace. We are currently based in Bangalore, India. The 2 founders are Prasun (IIT Delhi, P&G, startup-exit with cash acquisition) & Khushboo (IIT Bombay, HBS MBA'12, Nike, Booz, currently-Inmobi). The team has a phenomenal RoR developer, awesome Android+UI developer, great UX designer and top notch iOS developer (to join soon) besides having a great Android mentor.

Opensource is a big draw for us. We even founded and support an opensource non-profit peer-to-peer network for physical(real) books viz. barter.li (https://github.com/barterli)


Idea 
====

An idea on its own is just that - an idea. I believe that the idea acts as a multiplier of sorts and the better the execution the more awesome the value which is created. For an awesome execution any startup team needs to be able to create an environment where massive amount of really good tech talent is attracted towards it for a sustainable competitive advantage.

**Idea as Multiplier**

Awful = -1,
Weak = 1,
So-so = 5,
Good = 10,
Great = 15,
Brilliant = 20,

**Execution as Value Creation**

No = $0,
Weak = $1k,
So-so = $10k,
Good = $100k,
Great = $1M,
Brilliant = $10M


The emergence of 3 Macro Trends
===============================

**Trend #1**

An IM (chat) is different from an email or a phone-call. Today world's 20% population[1] is a Monthly Active User(MAU) of an Instant Messenger (IM) like WhatsApp, WeChat, Line, Viber etc. With this number growing fast and large populations coming on them various efforts towards monetizing these platforms have been initiated. Line & WeChat have tried to focus on Brands and local business/commerce but still as their original positioning is consumer centric (chat with friends) they have been restricted by their very positioning to go full fledged into business.

So essentially the result is that 1.4 Billion people are using IMs but businesses are yet to show big presence on any such similar platform.

**Trend #2**

For much of the past century, the 40-hour workweek and its employer-provided benefits were the foundation of most economies. That was then. Now, independent work is the new normal.

Freelancers, independent contractors and temp workers are on their way to making up the **majority** of the U.S. labor force. They number 42 million, or one-third of all workers, expected to rise to 40% in next 5 years[2]. A number of factors both economic and cultural are causing the independent workforce to swell. An Elance-oDesk survey found an overwhelming 89% of freelancers prefer work flexibility to a traditional corporate career. 

The latest batch of Y-Combinator[3] also emphasized long-term shifts in the workforce will **change the way** we think about the labor market. Y Combinator-backed startups like Zen99, Fixed, and Checkr, while appearing simple at first glance, will make that transition smoother.

**Trend #3**

Google optimized its battery usage with 'GPS On' really well with its Android version 4.0+ around the same time as Apple's similar optimizations. As result from last 12-18 months, location can be kept 'always-on' on mobile phones and that has made 'local marketplace' a real opportunity **only now**. This means everyone is at the beginning of the race - the internet biggies and startups alike. 

Tindr, Uber & now Thumbtack have created a massive wave which made **Local Marketplace** really hot. After recent Uber's $1.2B[4] and Thumbtack's $100M[5] funding VC's seem to understand that something big is happening.


Horizontal vs. Vertical
=======================

In five years that you’re going to have an app for house cleaners, an app for electricians, an app for tutors, and on and on. **No.** You’re going to have one app to stay in touch with the professionals that you know and love. Breadth is the ultimate value proposition and a peer-to-peer is the holy grail of platform/marketplaces. Someone needs to rise to the challenge and face it head-on rather than focusing on vertical niches.

Millions of businesses on the Internet
======================================

Its my favourite example. My mother never had an email, nor did she have a facebook account but she is a WhatsApp pro. She uses it like a champion and since the day I bought her a smartphone I have seen marked change in her anxiety levels as she enjoys the real time connect which WhatsApp provides her with her children including me. Similar to her there are billions of people who are going to come online not on a facebook or email client but a WhatsApp[6]. And among these billions are going to be 100s of millions who will have businesses and their business will never come online on a Google+ page, website or a facebook page. The future belongs to mobile and usability for masses.

This piece was written as a pre-read for our potential CTO candidates. If you are interested in joining us and making this dream a reality then write to us right away.
