Idea 
====

An idea on its own is just that - an idea. I believe that the idea acts as a multiplier of sorts and the better the execution the more awesome the value which is created.

**Idea as Multiplier**

Awful = -1,
Weak = 1,
So-so = 5,
Good = 10,
Great = 15,
Brilliant = 20,

**Execution as Value Creation**

No = $0,
Weak = $1k,
So-so = $10k,
Good = $100k,
Great = $1M,
Brilliant = $10M

The emergence of 3 Macro Trends
===============================

**Trend #1**

An IM (chat) is different from an email or a phone-call. Today world's 20% population is a Monthly Active User(MAU) of an Instant Messenger (IM) like WhatsApp, WeChat, Line, Viber etc. With this number growing fast and large populations coming on them various efforts towards monetizing these platforms have been initiated. Line & WeChat have tried to focus on Brands and local business/commerce but still as their original positioning is consumer centric (chat with friends) they have been restricted by their very positioning to go full fledged into business.

So essentially the result is that 1.4 Billion people are using IMs but businesses are yet to show big presence on any such similar platform.

**Trend #2**




**Trend #3**

Google optimized its battery usage with 'GPS On' really well with its Android version 4.0+ around the same time as Apple's similar optimizations. As result from last 12-18 months location can be kept always on on mobile phones and that has made local marketplace a real opportunity **only now**. Tindr, Uber & now Thumbtack have made **Local Marketplace** really hot. After recent Uber's $1.2B and Thumbtack's $100M funding VC's seem to understand that something big is happening.



Horizontal vs. Vertical
=======================


In five years that you’re going to have an app for house cleaners, an app for electricians, an app for tutors, and on and on. 

No. You’re going to have one app to stay in touch with the professionals that you know and love.
