Idea 
====

An idea on its own is just that an idea. I agree that idea acts as a multiplier of sorts and the better the execution the more awesome the value which is created.

Awful Idea = -1 /n
Weak Idea = 1/n
So-so Idea = 5/n
Good Idea = 10/n
Great Idea = 15/n
Brilliant Idea = 20/n
 
No Execution = $0
Weak Execution = $1,000
So-so Execution = $10,000
Good Execution = $100,000
Great Execution = $1,000,000
Brilliant Execution = $10,000,000

No. You’re going to have one app to stay in touch with the professionals that you know and love.
